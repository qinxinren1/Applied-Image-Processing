## Set up the environment

conda create -n faceMorph python=3.10
conda activate faceMorph
conda install dlib = 19.24.0
conda install opencv = 4.6.0
conda install pillow = 10.0.1
conda install numpy = 1.26.1
conda install pytorch = 2.0.1

## How to run the program
python main.py
input images are stored in the directory ./input
In this program I have stored 3 images which can all be used for testing
user can also change the output location, and the length of output video

## UI interface interpolation
1. click 'load image 1' and 'load image 2' to upload images from disk
2. click 'process image' button to detect the landmarks
3. click the images to add more landmarks, the added landmarks are in blue
4. click 'compute result' to generate the morphing sequence
5. see the output video in output folder
